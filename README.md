# Legacy Texture Loader
 Allows loading of legacy skins and texture mods.

To load textures, navigate to VTOL VR/@Mod Loader/LegacyTextureLoader

(If this folder doesn't exist, either load the mod once by running the game or create it yourself.)

In this folder, create subfolders for each texture mod you wish to load, and place their .png files in there. If the mod you wish to load has a png file with only a number, like 2.png, ignore that file.

Example:
LegacyTextureLoader/F45Skin/mat_sevtf_ext.png

To create your own texture mods, name the texture .png file the same as the material you want to edit.

Disclaimer, I am not sure if helmet and object skins will work, i only tried this for plane re-textures and skins
